## CPEN 321

CPEN 321 (Software Engineering) is a UBC Breadth Elective for Computer Engineering students covering the following topics:

Engineering practices for the development of non-trivial software-intensive systems including requirements specification, software architecture, 
implementation, verification, and maintenance. Iterative development. Recognized standards, guidelines, and models. 

60% of the course grade is based on a client-server mobile application project in which our team has to implement the idea proposed by 
another team, whilst they implement our project. 

## Overview

Our application allows users to post details about services (eg: piano lessons, painting houses) they provide and other users to contact them to avail the services. The application was built for Android devices using Java, Node.js, and MongoDB.
